Academic integrity
Academic integrity at its core is about honesty and responsibility 
and is fundamental to Curtin Singapore’s expectations of you. 
This means that all of your work should be your own and it 
should be underpinned by integrity, which means to act ethically, 
honestly and with fairness.
Academic misconduct
Academic misconduct means acting dishonestly or unfairly in 
connection with any examination or other assessment task, or 
other academic work.
Types of academic misconduct
Plagiarism
Plagiarism means presenting the work or property of 
another person as if it were one’s own without appropriate 
acknowledgment or referencing. Plagiarism constitutes academic 
misconduct and parties involved will be penalised accordingly.
Plagiarism includes:
•	 Copying of sentences, paragraphs or creative products (in 
whole or in part) which are the work of other persons without 
due acknowledgment. Creative products include webpages, 
books, articles, theses, unpublished works, working papers, 
seminar and conference papers, internal reports, lecture notes 
or recordings, computer files, images or video
•	 Too closely paraphrasing sentences, paragraphs or themes 
without due acknowledgment
•	 Using another person’s work (including words, music, creative 
or visual artefacts, computer source code, designs, problem 
solutions or ideas)
•	 In the case of collaborative group projects, falsely representing 
the individual contributions of the collaborating partners
•	 Submitting work which has been produced by someone else 
– including friends, family or a paid contracting service (This is 
known as contract cheating, assessment outsourcing or ghost 
writing.)
•	 Submitting one’s own previously assessed or published work 
for assessment or publication elsewhere, without appropriate 
acknowledgement (self-plagiarism)
•	 Using language translation or paraphrasing services (either 
online or contracted) to disguise original source text (cross-
lingual or back translation plagiarism, and spinning)

Student Handbook for Undergraduate and Postgraduate Programs 2024  |  15
CONTENTS

Cheating
Cheating means acting dishonestly or unfairly in order to gain an 
advantage. Examples include:
•	 Cheating in an exam, test or supervised assessment activity.
Considered Academic misconduct:
•	 Being in possession of unauthorised materials 
•	 Having a mobile phone or other electronic device in an 
examination or testing environment
•	 Copying answers from another person or permitting another 
student to copy answers
•	 Exchanging notes, talking or communicating with another 
student in an examination or test
•	 Improperly obtaining prior knowledge of an examination or 
test paper and using that knowledge in the examination or 
test or providing that information to a student(s) who are yet to 
undertake the examination or test
Considered General misconduct:
•	 Removing an examination paper from an examination room 
when it is specified that the paper is not to be retained by 
the student; storing or sharing an examination paper that was 
illegally obtained
•	 Disrupting an examination or assessment activity in any way
•	 Impersonating a student in an examination or arranging for 
another to impersonate, take or complete the assessment on 
your behalf.
•	 Cheating in an assessment or other assessable work by 
submitting written or creative work which has been drafted 
or produced by someone else – including friends, family or a 
paid contracting service (this is known as contract cheating, 
assessment outsourcing or ghost writing) and claiming 
authorship for it. This includes:
•	 Allowing someone or an organisation to draft or complete an 
assessment task on your behalf
•	 Contracting another person to do the work for you
•	 Purchasing work from another source
•	 Allowing or contracting another person to edit and substantially 
change your work.
Collusion
Collusion occurs when two or more individuals combine their 
efforts in order to deceive others. In an academic context, 
this can occur if you work with others on an assignment that 
is meant to be individual or if you help another student to 
complete an assignment against instructions. This is also 
referred to as ‘collaborating too closely.’ The result is that you 
submit assignments which are very similar without admitting to 
collaboration.
While collusion is considered to be a different form of academic 
misconduct to plagiarism, similar penalties will apply to both 
students involved in the incident.
Collusion differs from collaboration in that the latter describes an 
activity in which students have been given permission to work 
together to accomplish a task. With collaboration, students are 
usually asked to submit a joint assignment under joint names. 
In order to avoid misunderstandings, it is essential that task 
parameters (i.e. how the task should be done and by whom) are 
specific and transparent.

CONTENTS

Falsification or fabrication of data or other content
Falsification or fabrication of data occurs when data is 
misrepresented within an assessment or research. Examples 
include:
•	 Fabrication is making up results and reporting them
•	 Falsification is altering results so that the research is not 
accurately represented
Academic misconduct ‘other’
Academic dishonesty that does not fall into the other misconduct 
categories.
•	 Falsifying medical certificates for assessment extension.
Curtin Singapore regards any act of cheating, collusion, 
falsification or fabrication of data, or dishonesty by way of 
plagiarism very seriously. There are strong penalties for 
breaches including annulment of results or termination from 
Curtin Singapore.
The following website contains information on how to avoid 
plagiarism by providing the information you will need to 
appropriately cite and reference your work: https://students.
curtin.edu.au/essentials/rights/academic-integrity/ 
Terminating or withdrawing enrolment
Curtin Singapore has the right to terminate or withdraw a 
student’s enrolment in response to serious misbehaviour or 
misconduct. Please refer to the Code of Conduct and Refund 
policy sections contained in this handbook for academic and 
financial penalties that may apply.
Academic status and conditional
Academic status
All students commence their course with an Academic Status 
of Good Standing. However, less than satisfactory academic 
performance will result in a review of the status to either 
Conditional or Terminated. Notification of Academic Status will be 
sent electronically via the Official Communication Channel (OCC) 
in OASIS.
Good standing
The student is achieving satisfactory course progress with a 
Semester Weighted Average (SWA) of 50 or higher and passing 
more than 50% of enrolled units for the study period whereby a 
student is permitted to continue in the course and re-enrol. 
Conditional
A student will be placed on Conditional Status if the student 
obtained a SWA of less than 50 and/or failed 50% or more of the 
units they were enrolled in for the study period. The student is 
permitted to continue in the course and re-enrol under conditions 
as determined.  
A student may be placed on Conditional status at the discretion 
of the Board of Examiners if they fail a core unit in the study 
period just ended. Their status of Conditional may be continued 
in subsequent study periods until the failed core unit is passed. 
However, if a student meets the criteria for Conditional status for a 
second consecutive study period, the student may be recommended 
for Course Termination. Students on Conditional status may be 
required to study only 3 units in the following study period. Students 
are encouraged to meet with a Student and Academic Services 
Officer to receive appropriate academic counselling.

Student Handbook for Undergraduate and Postgraduate Programs 2024  |  17
CONTENTS

Terminated
The act of terminating a student from a course on academic 
performance grounds constitutes the decision that the student 
has not achieved satisfactory course progress. Students that are 
on a status of Terminated have had a status of Conditional and 
a current SWA of less than 50 or failed 50% or more of the units 
they were enrolled in the study period.  
Termination may also occur if a student has a current Conditional 
status and failed any unit for a second time or failed to 
satisfactorily complete a practical or clinical placement for a 
second time. 
The student is not permitted to continue in the course or re-enrol 
in the course without approval from Curtin University.
An international student on a Student’s Pass who has been 
terminated from course will be reported to Immigration & 
Checkpoints Authority of Singapore (ICA) for cancellation of his/
her Student’s Pass.

standards of the assessment.
Examinations
The examination timetable is released 4 weeks prior to the 
examination period through the Official Communications Channel 
on OASIS. It is the students’ responsibility to make themselves 
aware of the location, time and length of the examination. 
Examinations may be scheduled on any day or time during the 
examination period. This may include Saturdays and evenings.

Further assessment
The Board of Examiners have the discretion over awarding 
Further Assessments and will consider whether the student has 
attempted all required assessment tasks and has only marginally 
failed the unit. Please note that a Further Assessment may not be 
used to remediate a penalty of misconduct. 
Students that have been granted a Further Assessment will be 
provided at least three working days’ notice.
It is the responsibility of students to be available to attend or 
complete the Further Assessment task at the notified time. A 
student who commits to other arrangements that prevent them 
from completing a Further Assessment task will not be entitled to 
another opportunity.
Deferred assessment
An Application for Assessment Extension and the relevant 
supporting documents must be submitted through the online form 
at https://students.curtin.edu.au/essentials/forms-documents/
forms/  before the due date of the assessment. The only exception 
is where your personal circumstances (e.g. illness) have prevented 
this. Such requests will only be accepted where the student is able 
to supply documentation that clearly supports his or her explanation 
within 5 working days of the due date of assessment.
Approval for Assessment Extension is not automatic. Students 
may be permitted by the Board of Examiners to defer an 
examination where specific criteria are met. 
Criteria for assessment extension
The student must satisfy the Unit Coordinator and Board of 
Examiners that the reason for not completing the assessment 
task was due to exceptional circumstances outside his or 
her control.
Circumstances that may warrant approval of an Assessment 
Extension include, but are not limited to:
•	 student illness, injury or medical condition, supported by a  
valid medical certificate
•	 family issues (for example, illness or bereavement, etc.)
•	 commitments to participate in elite sport or other activities that 
warrant favourable consideration
•	 commitment to assist with community service activities
•	 unavoidable and unexpected work commitments  
(for example, relocation)
Students will be advised of the outcome on their application for 
Assessment Extension during the publication of final examination 
results. A “DA” interim result is the formal approval by the 
Board of Examiners for a student to complete an outstanding 
assessment for a unit at a later date.
Students will be provided with at least 3 working days’ notice 
of the new examination date or time and it is the student’s 
responsibility to be available to attend or complete the 
assessment extension task at the notified time.
A student who commits to other arrangements that prevents him 
or her from completing a deferred assessment is not entitled to

 GRADES
DESCRIPTION
APPLICATION
GNS
Grade Not 
Submitted
A result in a unit is not available to the Board of Examiners because marking is not complete. A GNS is an interim grade 
and will be converted to a final grade within one month after the Board of Examiners. Any extension will be approved by 
the Academic Registrar (or authorised officer).
X

Once the Further Assessment is completed, the student will be awarded a grade of either PX (Pass After Further 
Assessment) or FX (Fail After Further Assessment). In both cases, for grade/mark units the original mark will be retained. 
An X grade will be converted to a final result by no later than the end of the next study period that the student would 
normally enrol in. Any extension will be approved by the Academic Registrar (or authorised officer).
DA
Deferred 
Assessment
Where an assessment task within a unit of study is approved to be done at a later date, but not later than the end of 
the next study period that the student would normally enrol in. A DA grade will be converted to a final result by no later 
than the end of the next study period that the student would normally enrol in. If exceptional circumstances exist, the 
conversion of a DA grade may be extended for one additional study period.
However, any extension beyond two additional study periods will be approved by the Academic Registrar (or authorised 
officer).
OA
Ongoing 
Assessment
This interim grade may be used where assessment tasks and assessment for a unit cover more than one study period 
(the study period of enrolment and the subsequent study period of enrolment). The OA grade may be used as an interim 
(holding) grade until the assessment tasks and assessment are completed for both study periods. An OA grade will be 
converted to a final result by no later than the end of the next study period that the student would normally enrol in. Any 
extension will be approved by the Academic Registrar (or authorised officer).

It is your responsibility as a student to attend all classes. Failure to attend the correct classes will result 
in your attendance not being recorded for that week.
Facial Recognition Attendance System 
Curtin Singapore adopts a contactless facial recognition 
technology where facial features are scanned and captured 
by the facial recognition terminal. The data captured are then 
downloaded and managed by the Student Attendance System 
(SAS) to generate attendance record.
Student’s attendance guidelines 
Students are expected to 
•	 arrive on time for each lesson;
•	 remain throughout the session for each lesson; and
•	 scan in using the facial recognition terminal at the beginning 
and the end of each lesson  
Attendance requirement 
All students
Students are required to maintain a minimum 75% attendance 
for each enrolled unit. Students who fail to obtain the minimum 
attendance requirement will not be eligible to sit for the 
final examination or receive grades for the final assessment, 
regardless of previous work submitted.
International students  
In addition to the requirements above, international students 
must achieve a minimum monthly attendance requirement of 
above 90%. Curtin Singapore shall inform Immigration and 
Checkpoint Authority (ICA) when an international student’s 
attendance is 90% or below, or has failed to attend classes 
for a continuous period of 7 days or more. This may lead to 
cancellation of the Student’s Pass.

Student Engagement Program (SEP)
An international student holding a Singapore Student’s Pass 
is required to be on campus for a minimum of 3 hours per day 
from Monday to Friday (except on public holidays or during non-
teaching weeks, including study review and exam weeks). 
Students must register their attendance on campus in the 
following circumstances: 
•	 if a student does not have a class scheduled on a  
particular day, he/she is expected to fulfil 3 consecutive hours 
on campus at any given time between 9am to 6pm  
(For example, student has 3 hours class every Monday to  
Thursday but none on Friday, the student must be on  
campus for 3 hours, at any time between 9am to 6pm  
every Friday undertaking Student Engagement  
Program (SEP))
•	 if a student’s class is run for less than 3 hours on a particular 
day (For example, student has a-1 hour tutorial class every 
Monday, student must continue to be on campus undertaking 
Student Engagement Program (SEP) to complete the remaining 
2 hours in order to meet the 3-hour per day requirement)
•	 If there is an overlap between the period where the student 
completes the Student Engagement Program (SEP) and the 
academic class, the attendance for SEP will be marked as 
absent.
Students may register their attendance for SEP onto Facial 
Recognition Terminal located at:
•	 Level 2 Library
•	 Level 3 UniHub
•	 Level 4 Student Connect
By scanning in and out of the terminal, students’ attendance are 
captured and monitored. 
Please note that SEP is compulsory for all international students. 
The SEP schedule for each international student is determined 
and pre-enrolled every study period. Students are able to check 
on Axis on the last working day before the commencement of the 
study period to determine which days they are required to attend 
the SEP.
Attendance will be monitored and will form part of ICA’s 90% 
attendance requirement. Warning letters will be issued to 
students who fail to meet this attendance percentage.
Absence Justification (AJ)
When a student is absent from class due to valid reasons, for 
example medical conditions, he/she is required to submit an AJ 
online via SAS Website at this link: http://sas.curtin.edu.sg
If you have a medical certificate issued by a registered medical 
practitioner in Singapore, it must be attached in the AJ request 
before the AJ can be approved. 
Please be advised if you have any assignments or examinations 
due, an approved AJ will not automatically extend or defer 
these dates.
Curtin Singapore reserves the right at its sole discretion to reject 
absence reasons that are invalid or non-justifiable.
In Singapore, it is a legal offence to present forged documents 
to support reasons for absence. Under Section 468 of the Penal 
Code, offenders may face up to 10 years imprisonment, or fined, 
or both.

For the avoidance of doubt, if the Student and/or his/her parent/
guardian receives any payment from the PEI or the Insurance 
Company pursuant to a provision of the Student Contract or

accordingly, any legal action arising out of or in connection with 
the Student Contract (“Proceedings”) may be brought in those 
courts and the parties irrevocably submit to the jurisdiction of 
those courts PROVIDED THAT nothing in this Clause shall limit 
the right of any party to take Proceedings in any other court of 
competent jurisdiction nor shall the taking of Proceedings in one or 
more jurisdictions preclude that party from taking Proceedings in 
any other jurisdiction, whether concurrently or not.
1.11	  Withdrawal of a unit 
Where a student withdraws from a unit before census date, no 
fee liability is incurred.  Any fees paid in respect of the unit will

presented
In the event of misconduct or fraudulent or forged material is 
presented, no refund will be granted.

action under Singapore’s consumer protection laws.

facilities have on students has become a vital part of the Curtin 
Singapore’s improvement measures. This has resulted in Curtin 
Singapore implementing a suite of regular student feedback 
surveys as part of the continual improvement process.
Student surveys are powerful tools to help Curtin Singapore 
to gather valuable data which allows for an in-depth analysis 
of the overall campus climate, at the same time rendering a 
representative picture of student views. We use the analysed 
results obtained in each survey to review our processes, course 
materials, teaching methods, etc. to ensure every student enjoys 
high quality education services.
